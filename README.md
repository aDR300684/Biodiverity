# Biodiversity Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data from the National Parks Service to explore the conservation statuses of various species and their distribution across different parks. The goal is to identify patterns in species endangerment and provide insights for conservation efforts.

## Key Findings
- **Distribution of Conservation Statuses**: The majority of species are classified as "Species of Concern," with fewer species listed as "Endangered," "Threatened," or "In Recovery."
- **Significance Testing**: Significant differences in conservation statuses were found across species categories, with Mammals, Fish, and Amphibians being more prone to endangerment.
- **Most Observed Species**: The most frequently observed species vary across different national parks, highlighting unique biodiversity in each park.

## Recommendations
- Focus conservation efforts on species categories with higher endangerment risks.
- Continue monitoring species classified as "Species of Concern" to prevent further decline.
